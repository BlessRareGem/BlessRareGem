# 👋 Hi, I'm Blessing — SOC Analyst | Cloud Security | Incident Response  

I’m a Security Operations Analyst with hands-on experience detecting, investigating, and responding to threats across cloud and on-prem environments. I specialize in **incident response**, **AWS security**, **SIEM operations**, **threat intelligence**, and **digital forensics**.

## 🔐 What I Do  
- **Security Monitoring & Analysis:** Investigate events, correlate logs, and respond to alerts using SIEM tools.  
- **Incident Response:** Build playbooks, triage incidents, perform evidence collection, and support containment & remediation.  
- **Cloud Security (AWS):** IAM hardening, CloudTrail/GuardDuty monitoring, and secure architecture design.  
- **Threat Hunting:** IOC-driven and behavior-based hunts across endpoints, logs, and cloud workloads.  
- **Digital Forensics:** Acquire, analyze, and interpret evidence from endpoints and systems.  
- **Automation:** Use Python/Bash for IR workflows and log data manipulation.
